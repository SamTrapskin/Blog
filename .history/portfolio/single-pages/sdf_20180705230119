                                    This was an idea I had to practice my skills in HTML and CSS. It was the first creation and design that
                                    I produced from scratch. This project was one that I had to put on hold and remains unfinished. I only completed the front page view,
                                    and my next step was going to be cleaning up the design and color in the navigation bar. </p>

                                    <p>Creating this helped me discover how much I enjoy clean and simple websites.</p>
