                                    I own a ton of movies. Some are on a hard drive, some are on a different hard drvie, and some are hard copies in a box in my
                                    laundry room.

                                    I created this app in AngularJS. I created it to keep track of not only which movies I had, but also where that movie lives.
                                    A reoccuring theme at Prime Digital Academy is that you work on projects long enough to understand the framework process and 
                                    concepts, but not long enough to complete the app sufficiently.

                                    Although I learned a lot about AngularJS, especially by the time I turned it in, I wasn't able to finish this concept. A few things

                                    <li>Connect to Movie Database API so that I could get a thumbnail image for each movie, as well as a small description. This would also
                                        automatically input the movie's release date, genre and legnth as well.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Create a filter that only shows movies by a selected genre.</li>
                                    <li>Design a view that list all movies and their information alphabetically to help in finding a movie quicker.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>I had a lot of fun making this app and plan to remake it in either React or Vue</p>
